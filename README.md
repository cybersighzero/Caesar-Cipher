# Caesar Cipher

Ever wanted to send secret messages like it’s 100 B.C.? Now you can.  
Built in Python, this project shifts your letters like Julius Caesar shifted power — one key at a time. Encrypt, decrypt, feel powerful.

Ideal for hiding lunch orders and mild gossip.

## About the Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect military communications. It works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of 3 to the right:  
`A → D`, `B → E`, `C → F`... and so on.

Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher laid the foundation for many modern cryptographic techniques.

## Late-Night Note

This 3AM, adrenaline-fueled decision to build a Caesar Cipher in Python was inspired by the THM room **["Cryptography Basics"](https://tryhackme.com/room/cryptographybasics)**, the first in the module **"Cryptography."**

Sometimes, impulse + caffeine = cool code.
